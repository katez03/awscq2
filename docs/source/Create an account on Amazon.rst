Create an account on Amazon
To log in, you must use an Amazon e-commerce account (if you donâ€™t have one, you can create one by following these steps)

Steps to create an Amazon account

Open the app or go to the official website Amazon
Create Amazon Account

Select Create a new Amazon account
Create Amazon Account

Create Amazon Account

New page appears, enter six-digit OTP in the space provided

Create Amazon Account

Note: Before creating an account, make sure you are using a valid mobile number because adding a mobile number is required to create a new account on Amazon.in, while adding a location email only is optional.

You can sign in to Your Account at any time by clicking Your Account at the top of each page. You just need to enter the same Mobile number or Email address and Password to access your account.
