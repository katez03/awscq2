.. note::

   Before creating an account, make sure you are using a valid mobile number because adding a mobile number is required to create a new account on Amazon.in, while adding an email only is optional.

You can sign in to Your Account at any time by clicking **Your Account** at the top of each page. You just need to enter the same Mobile number or Email address and Password to access your account.
